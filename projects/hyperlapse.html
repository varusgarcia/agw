            <h1>Hyperlapse Tutorial</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="content_text_description side_space_100 projects_page_description " >
            <p>Hyperapse is the technique of taking timelapses while in motion. We could say that the slider technique is a Hyperlapse with minor movement between each picture. Because we don't normally have a 100m long slider (for that I have another Tutorial, in which I explain how you can do your own Timelapse-Cablecam), we have to position the camera with a tripod and move it by hand. There are some new and expensive gadgets that will do that for us like the <a href="https://vimeo.com/24199087" target="_blank" >Camtrac</a>. Also, the trend is to forget about the technique and leave all the work for the stabilisation software, like the <a href="https://vimeo.com/63653873" target="_blank" >Google Street Hyperlapse Project</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/104409950" target="_blank" >"Hyperlapse" from Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twncW4PLdsY" target="_blank" >"Microsoft Hyperlapse"</a>. Smartphones are getting better at this because of the advanced sensors but there is a level that just cant be achived with such softwares and the results will almost always seem artificial and have distorsion. To achive that professional look, some time has to be invested in the process and it's going to need some practice. I hope i can teach you all what I've learned from my failed attempts.</p>

            <p>Before you start with the shooting, we recommend you to decide what method want to use, either the "Fixed Point Method" or the "Imaginary Line Method". There is a third method that is more experimental and not so common, we'll call it "Stop Motion Method".So, what is the difference? It’s basically that in the first method, the camera maintains a point of reference from the beginning to the end at the same position. In the second one the camera maintains its position by imagining a straight line and mainlining it with the tripod. We'll explain which method is more convenient in which situation and show some examples of each.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="content_text top_space_50 bottom_space_50">
            <p>The Fixed point method is easier when you are shooting but requires more editing. It is the best for moving in circles or other shapes, as long as you don't lose the point of reference. You can also change the point of reference but we recommend to always follow the same one, because this is the only way to stabilize the whole video later. It gives a more static result but it allows you to center the attention of the viewer in your subject. This is a better solution if you want to make a video about a specific monument, for example, and you want to center the viewers attention to it. The editing part of the process requires a certain skill and some time, depending also on the quality of the photographs.In the video you can see some examples of how it looks.</p>

              <p><b>Chatlotterstrasse, Potsdam (Germany). 2015</b><br>Here is an example of the point of reference method, in which we chose the cathedral at the end of the street becuase it gave us nice points of reference. You might think we were shooting from day to night, we did't, we shoot one time at day, let's say 100m. and one at night, starting at the last 20m. from the previous shot. Then, after correctly stabilizing both clips, we joined the results in After Effects. To achive that, it's important to be consistent with the distances in which you shoot, especially in the gap in which both clips are going to overlap.</p>

              <p><b>Park Sanssouci, Potsdam (Germany). 2015</b><br>In this one, we combine frontal with lateral movement. The only thing to keep in mind when we want to do the transition from one to aother is to make a nice curve. Imagine seeing the route you want to do from above and ask yourselve if it is a nice transition form one movement to another.</p>

              <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ioVyKfQiTn0">this tutorial</a> we show how to stabilize the Hyperlapse using the camera stabilization in Adobe After Effects. This gives you the option to stabilize position only or position and rotation. For the last one, you'll need an additional point of reference.You can also try to stabilize the Hyperlapse with the warp stabilizer in Adobe After Effects or Premiere Pro. This method is fully automatic and requires no skills</p>

            <div class="content_text top_space_50 bottom_space_50">
              <p>The Imaginary line method changes in the way you move, you'll need to pay more attention on where you place the tripod and in which direction you shoot. It’s more complex to shoot but requires less skill on the editing side. Because of that, we recommend to search for some lines that can help you, like some kind of tile arrangement on the ground that you can use as reference. It is really easy to stabilize a hyperlapse shot this way, because you can always use the warp stabilizer in Adobe After Effects or in Adobe Premiere Pro and it does the hard work for you. Here we show some examples for this method:</p>

                <p><b>Preciados Street, Madrid (Spain). 2014</b><br>This is an expample for the imaginary line method. As you might ahve noticed, the hyperlapse is not completely smooth, it has some distorsion caused by the Warp stabilizer. Why does the warp stabilizer make this? Well, it just tries to create a smooth result, and if the sequence has one frame that that was taken wrong, you will notice it in the final result. The only thing you can do if you have this problem and you don't want to shoot the sequence again, is apply some blur to the edges and maybe some vignette effect.</p>

                  <p>This method consists on moving the camera and the point of reference at the same time. This point of reference can be a person that moves with a music track or an object that you move for each shot. It may seem confusing at first but gives a really cool result.<br>The greatest example is the video <a href="https://vimeo.com/47793390" target="_blank">Dream Music Part II</a> by <a href="http://www.permagrinfilms.com/" target="_blank">PermagrimFilms</a>. They have also done a really cool <a href="https://youtu.be/tRAjnYR0O3M" target="_blank">Behind the Scenes </a>video in which they explain how the achived such good results.</p>
