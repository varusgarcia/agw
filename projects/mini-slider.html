            <p>This is a tutorial on how to do your own mini-slider for GoPro or any other lightweight camera out there. It's not ment to be a step by step tutorial, because you are probably not going to have the exact same materials I used. Because of that, it's more an extended overview on how I did it, so you can get a good picture on what you really need to acomplish a good result. I have some experience on building sliders, mainly bigger motorized sliders for video and Timelapse. From that experience I've learned that with a DIY slider you are never going to achieve that professional smoothness that you get with bought sliders, but that, spending a lot less you get a pretty good result. For now, this tutorial will cover how to make an hand-powered slider. Maybe later on I will extend it to show how you can motorize it.</p>

            <p>If you want to mount the slider on a tripod, I recommend you to buy at least two Tripod Nuts (just search "1/4 BSW x5/8" Whitworth Nuts" on Ebay), drill a hole trough the bottom of the aluminum rectangular pipe and glue the nut with two-component glue.
            <br>On the dolly, you might want some sort of tripod head. What I did was use the tripod adapter from GoPro fixed to the dolly with a tripod screw and a washer (just search "1/4 BSW x5/8" Whitworth Bolt" on Ebay). To rotate the GoPro, y just apply force. </p>

          <div class="content_text top_space_50 bottom_space_50">
            <p>The Fixed point method is easier when you are shooting but requires more editing. It is the best for moving in circles or other shapes, as long as you don't lose the point of reference. You can also change the point of reference but we recommend to always follow the same one, because this is the only way to stabilize the whole video later. It gives a more static result but it allows you to center the attention of the viewer in your subject. This is a better solution if you want to make a video about a specific monument, for example, and you want to center the viewers attention to it. The editing part of the process requires a certain skill and some time, depending also on the quality of the photographs.In the video you can see some examples of how it looks.</p>

                <p>(Click to PLAY/PAUSE)<br>Here is an example of the point of reference method, in which we chose the cathedral at the end of the street becuase it gave us nice points of reference. You might think we were shooting from day to night, we did't, we shoot one time at day, let's say 100m. and one at night, starting at the last 20m. from the previous shot. Then, after correctly stabilizing both clips, we joined the results in After Effects. To achive that, it's important to be consistent with the distances in which you shoot, especially in the gap in which both clips are going to overlap.</p>

                  <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ioVyKfQiTn0">this tutorial</a> we show how to stabilize the Hyperlapse using the camera stabilization in Adobe After Effects. This gives you the option to stabilize position only or position and rotation. For the last one, you'll need an additional point of reference.You can also try to stabilize the Hyperlapse with the warp stabilizer in Adobe After Effects or Premiere Pro. This method is fully automatic and requires no skills</p>

                <div class="content_text top_space_50 bottom_space_50">
                  <p>The Imaginary line method changes in the way you move, you'll need to pay more attention on where you place the tripod and in which direction you shoot. It’s more complex to shoot but requires less skill on the editing side. Because of that, we recommend to search for some lines that can help you, like some kind of tile arrangement on the ground that you can use as reference. It is really easy to stabilize a hyperlapse shot this way, because you can always use the warp stabilizer in Adobe After Effects or in Adobe Premiere Pro and it does the hard work for you. Here we show some examples for this method:</p>

                    <p>This method consists on moving the camera and the point of reference at the same time. This point of reference can be a person that moves with a music track or an object that you move for each shot. It may seem confusing at first but gives a really cool result.<br>The greatest example is the video <a href="https://vimeo.com/47793390" target="_blank">Dream Music Part II</a> by <a href="http://www.permagrinfilms.com/" target="_blank">PermagrimFilms</a>. They have also done a really cool <a href="https://youtu.be/tRAjnYR0O3M" target="_blank">Behind the Scenes </a>video in which they explain how the achived such good results.</p>
